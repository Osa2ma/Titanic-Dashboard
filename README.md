# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis 

## 📌 Objective

Inspired by the iconic line from the Titanic movie —  
> _"Step back, sir! Women and children only!"_  

Our goal was to investigate whether survival on the Titanic was truly based on humanity and selflessness,  
or if other factors like **social class**, **age**, and **gender** played a bigger role.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

Since this was done entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, the cleaning steps were as follows:

- **Cabin column dropped** due to a high percentage of missing values.
- **Missing Age values** were filled based on passengers' **honorifics** (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss) using the **average age** of each group.
- **Age groups** were then created:
  - `Children`: 1–12  
  - `Teenagers`: 13–18  
  - `Adults`: 19–59  
  - `Elderly`: 60+

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Total passengers analyzed:** 1000  
- **Survivors:** 492  
- **Women aboard:** 394  
- **Children aboard:** 164  

### Survival Rates by Gender:
- 👩‍🦰 **Female survival rate:** ~58.6%  
- 👨 **Male survival rate:** ~43.1%

### Other Observations:
- **Class** had a major impact:
  - Women in **1st and 2nd class** had the highest survival chances.
  - Men who survived were mostly from **2nd class**.
  - **Children** had a decent survival rate, but not as high as Hollywood suggests.

## 🧠 Conclusion

While gender did influence survival, **class was a stronger predictor**.  
The popular narrative of "women and children first" holds some truth —  
but the full story is much more complex.
